## The Problem
In this day and age, can we trust any product presented to us? How do you know if the product is real or fake? First Copy/Duplicate product is readily available and makes manipulation easy. For example, any T-shirt/Shoes we buy online,we don't know it is original or duplicate.

## The Solution
